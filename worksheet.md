# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  *   Websites that allow for the hosting of version controlled documents
      The commit history on bitbucket is more informative as it shows where the code has been forked and when it has been merged
      back into the codebase
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
      Matthew Roberts  
  * Who made the first commit to repository A? 
      Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
      Dave Pearce
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? 🤔 If not, what do you think happened?
    Both projects are active with commits happening within the past month. Although for the github repository it is less active than in the past
  * 🤔 Which file in each project has had the most activity?
    data/qualtrics.csv with 6102 changes in repository A

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

Red vs. Blue
